This is the code for running the Stochastic Multicloud model described in
FMK13. To compile and run the code needs the following steps:

Compiling
=========

To generate the Makefiles run
    cmake .

Then, to compile the binary run
    make

Running
=======

To run the file simply execute
    ./mcnde


Post-processing
===============

The code outputs the raw binary fields to a file called "snap_shots". To post
process this output into a standard netcdf file, use the load.py script. It
requires a standard scientific python installation (python v3) and the xray python package. 

To create the output "data.nc" simple run 
    python load.py
in the same directory as "snap_shots".


Changing parameters and run length
==================================

The source code needs to be edited manually. In the file
"multicloud_newform...." some of the usefull variables are

    tend   # length of run
    n      # number of grid points
